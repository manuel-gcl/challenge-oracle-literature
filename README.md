# Literature App

This project was developed for **Java backend specialization** from **Alura's Oracle One** program.
The Literature App consist in a command-line Java application that allows users to search books from [Gutendex Library API](https://gutendex.com/) and store them in a local database.
The main goal of the project was to deepen knowledge of Java programming, learn about databases, Hibernate, and Spring Boot.

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE yourdbname TO youruser;
```
- Configure the database connection:
  After creating the database, you will need to configure the connection in the application.
  Update the database connection details in the 'application.properties' file with your information or set enviroment variables.
